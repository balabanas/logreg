# Logistic Regression
Custom logistic classifier with numpy. The task was to write missed components of logistic classifier, using vector and matrix operations in numpy, namely:
* loss calculation
* gradient calculation for gradient descent
* regularization term for loss and gradient
* creating random batches for training iterations
* update vector of weights in training iterations
* prediction: probability calculation and class labeling

Try this and compare the result to `scikit-learn` linear `SGDClassifier` in `homework.ipynb` notebook.
